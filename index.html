					<hr>
					<p>My name is Rebekah Paige Smith, I am currently an IT Fellow at CURE International.
					<br/><br/>As I've been working with the hardware part of my Computer Science degree this
					summer I have found a love in the hands-on aspects of the job. But I still hope to find
					a Software Development position that I can thrive in, and gain much needed real world
					experience in.
					<br/><br/>This summer I have been blessed with an opportunity to work with CURE International 
					on their Technology Team. My official title is IT Fellow, but that doesn't explain what I 
					am doing very well. I will be traveling to six of the ten CURE Hospitals helping to install 
					a new wifi system and do general IT work for the hospitals as needed. I have had a passion 
					for traveling since I was very young. Since I have such a love of travel and technology
					this job is a perfect fit for me, and for the needs of CURE as an organization.<br/><br/></p>

							CURE International has a hospital in each of these countries, and I will be installing a

                    helping them create an interface that made it much more user friendly.

							watch my first surgery, and I learned from two amazing guys how to do my installations for the
							rest of the summer. This trip was my first CURE Hospital, and will always be one of my favourites!<br/><br/>

                			This trip was my first trip to Africa, and my first trip with CURE alone. I hopped on a plane in 
							Harrisburg, PA and landed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. I knew very little about what I was getting myself
							into. I waited at the airport for my driver, hoping he would know who I was! Then the adventures began.
							Once my two weeks in Ethiopia were over, I made my way to Blantyre, Malawi! This hospital was my favourite
							of the summer. The people were kind and loving. The installation did not go as planned at all, but I
							learned to adapt very quickly! And just as fast as it began, it was over. I was on a plane back to the USA, 
							waiting for my next trip.<br/><br/>

                       		My time in the USA before I flew to Kenya went faster that I thought was possible. One minute I was tired,
							and jetlagged. Then all of a sudden I was on a plane to Kenya! When I got to Kenya, I knew pretty much what 
							I was getting myself into, I'd talked to everyone, and I'd been to Africa before, so how hard could it be?
							God tested my patience and my ability to be alone in Kenya. Then my time was over, and I was flying to Uganda.
							I was ready, this was my fifth CURE Hospital, how hard could it be? I know the drill, get the information, and 
							get to the installation! Wow, I could not have been more wrong. God was teaching me humility in Uganda. But
							even through that, suddenly I was on a flight home. Back to Harrisburg, back to HQ, back to "normalcy".<br/><br/>
