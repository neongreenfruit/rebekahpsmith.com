						This project was the creation of a new parking system for Messiah College. 
						We needed to move away from the software that we had been using. The end of

					As a workstudy in the Messiah College Help Desk, I was 
					expected to go where I was needed. Typically I was asked
					to help troubleshoot users problems, many times this meant
					going to their office and sitting with them until one of 
					two things happened, I solved the problem, or I could 
					accurately relay a more robust picture of the problem to my boss.
					I was initially hired because of my understanding of Macs, and this
					was what I was mostly asked to work on. Through my time at the Help Desk
					I learned a lot about how to work with people, and how to help users 
					solve their problems.

							watch my first surgery, and I learned from two amazing fun co-workers how to do my installations for the
							rest of the summer. This trip was my first CURE Hospital, and will always be one of my favourites!<br/><br/>

                			This trip was my first trip to Africa, and my first trip with CURE, alone. I hopped on a plane in 
							Harrisburg, PA and landed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. I knew very little about what I was getting myself
							into. I waited at the airport for my driver, hoping he would know who I was! Then the adventures began.
							Once my two weeks in Ethiopia were over, I made my way to Blantyre, Malawi! This hospital was my favourite
							of the summer. The people were kind and loving. The installation did not go as planned at all, but I
							learned to adapt very quickly! And just as fast as it began, it was over. I was on a plane back to the USA, 
							waiting for my next trip.<br/><br/>

                       		My time in the USA before I flew to Kenya went faster that I thought was possible. One minute I was tired,
							and jetlagged. Then all of a sudden I was on a plane to Kenya! When I got to Kenya, I knew pretty much what 
							I was getting myself into, I'd talked to everyone, and I'd been to Africa before, so how hard could it be?
							God tested my patience and my ability to be alone in Kenya. Then my time was over, and I was flying to Uganda.
							I was ready, this was my fifth CURE Hospital, I should be good at this by now! I know the drill, get the information, and 
							get to the installation! Wow, I could not have been more wrong. God taught me humility in Uganda. But
							even through that, suddenly I was on a flight home. Back to Harrisburg, back to HQ, back to "normalcy".<br/><br/>

                       		It's been a few months now since I was in Zambia and Malawi, but I'm finally ready to write a little about my trip.
							I can not believe that I spent the summer traveling around the world. I spent lots of time over the last few months
							thinking about how God changed me in Zambia. One of the big changes I see in myself is the idea that I don't need 
							recognition for the work that I do. During my time in Zambia I had the opportunity to see a group of Plastic Surgeons
							get total recognition for the surgeries that they did, and at the time I felt a little sad that no one noticed the work
							that I was doing. But through much reflexive thinking I realized that I need to believe that the work I had the 
							chance to do was important, more important that anyone noticing me, or the work I did.<br/><br/>
